Python's built-in scope
50xp

Here you're going to check out Python's built-in scope, which is really just a
built-in module called builtins. However, to query builtins, you'll need to import
builtins 'because the name builtins is not itself built in...No, I’m serious!'
(Learning Python, 5th edition, Mark Lutz). After executing import builtins in the
IPython Shell, execute dir(builtins) to print a list of all the names in the module
builtins. Have a look and you'll see a bunch of names that you'll recognize! Which
of the following names is NOT in the module builtins?

Possible Answers
'sum'
'range'
'array'
'tuple'
